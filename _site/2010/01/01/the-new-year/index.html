<p>For as long as I can remember, my Dad has been a big proponent of eating black-eyed peas on New Year&#39;s Day for luck in the coming year.&Acirc;&nbsp; I adopted that superstition a while back without really wondering where that tradition came from.&Acirc;&nbsp; After a bit of research, it seems likely that this practice was the result of a mistranslation and confusion between the Arabic word for fenugreek <em>(Rubiya)</em> and the word for black-eyed peas (<em>Lubiya)</em>.&Acirc;&nbsp; Fortunately for us, <em>Lubiya</em> won out and the Jewish custom of eating symbols of good luck on the New Year was brought to the American South by Sephardi Jews in the early 1700&#39;s.</p>

<p>The Civil War brought the black-eyed pea to a wider audience.&Acirc;&nbsp; As General Sherman made his was through the South pillaging foods stores, crops and livestock, his troops left the black-eyed pea alone.&Acirc;&nbsp; The black-eyed pea, also know as the <em>cowpea</em>, is purported to have been ignored as the Northerners did not recognize it as anything other than fodder for livestock.</p>

<p>From there, the black-eyed pea gained its notoriety as a symbol of prosperity, as they swell when cooked.&Acirc;&nbsp; Served alongside greens, symbolizing money and cooked with pork, representing forward progress, this legume became the center of many place settings in the South on New Year&#39;s Day.</p>
