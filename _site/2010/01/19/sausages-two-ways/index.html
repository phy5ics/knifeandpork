  <h2>Sausages, Two Ways</h2>
  <p class="meta">19 Jan 2010</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phy5ics/4289305964/" title="Sausages, Two Ways by phy5ics, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2715/4289305964_be8c866d96.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="Sausages, Two Ways" /></a></p>

<p>First off, no, this post is not about your mom&#39;s favorite porno movie - I&#39;m keeping this strictly professional.  Well, other than the introductory sentence.  Anyway, wandering around the &#39;hood in the cold and ending up with canning supplies from <a href="http://www.thebrooklynkitchen.com/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Kitchen</a> and some full-on amazingness from the evil mad scientists at <a href="http://the-meathook.com/" target="_blank">The Meat Hook</a> in the form of bacon-cheeseburger and bahn mi sausages, I needed a plan.  The balmy January temperatures on Monday coupled with the MLK holiday (oh yeah, and beer) provided sufficient inspiration to fire up the grill and do up some sausages the right way.  High brow/low brow was in full effect with globe trotting sausages on a flight from New York to Vietnam with a layover in Milwaukee.</p>

<h3>Beer Brats, Master Recipe</h3>

<p>Being as how I live in Greenpoint, there&#39;s no better way to use the seemingly inexhaustible supply of Zyweic that to use it to prepare some brats.
<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
<li>Sausages (get them from <a href="http://the-meathook.com/" target="_blank">The Meat Hook</a>, seriously)</li>
<li>Beer (two tall-boys of Zyweic is enough to cover about 6 sausages, depending on the diameter and depth of the pan)</li>
<li>1 onion, sliced into 1/4 inch rings</li>
<li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
</ul>
<h5>Method</h5>
<ol>
<li>Place ingredients in a pot large enough to accommodate the sausages and bring to a boil over medium heat.</li>
<li>After 8 minutes, turn the sausages.  Cook another 8 minutes.  Carefully remove the sausages from the pot and reserve.</li>
<li>Pour off the beer and simmer the onions for another 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Finish the sausages off on a grill, about 2-3 minutes per side, depending on the heat of the coals.  Toast the buns on the grill and serve.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Milwaukee</h3>

<p>You don&#39;t have to drink like you&#39;re from Milwaukee to appreciate these sausages.  Although they do taste better when you do.  Not that I want to discourage you from making these, while they were amazing, next time, I&#39;m totally going to do these francheezie-style.  If you&#39;re not from Chicago, then you probably have no idea what I&#39;m talking about.  So let me introduce you to the ultimate Da Bears heart-attack-inducing amazingness in the universe.  However, my lawyer advised that I insert this legalese: <i>By reading this, I hereby swear that I will not hold the author of this website accountable in any manner for any negative health- or relationship-related consequences.</i> With that out of the way, let&#39;s get down to business: First, you take a hot dog (for full-on artery hardening I wholly endorse the usage of Bacon-Cheeseburger Sausages), then wrap that in American cheese.  Then, because that might actually be healthy or make it&#39;s way onto a school lunch menu, wrap that in bacon.  And because that might somehow leave your cardiologist with something to say about your dietary habits, deep-fry that muthaf*cka so he/she can&#39;t say anything, only pick up his/her jaw from the floor knowing that you/your insurance company will soon be paying him/her for your quadruple bypass.
<ul>
<li>Grilled Bacon-Cheeseburger Sausages (from <a href="http://the-meathook.com/" target="_blank">The Meat Hook</a>, duh)</li>
<li>Toasted buns</li>
<li>Cheddar cheese</li>
<li>Mustard</li>
<li>Grilled onions (see above)</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Vietnam</h3>

<p>Too bad I can&#39;t figure out how to get the appropriate little accent mark over the &quot;a&quot; in Bahn Mi.  Either way, here&#39;s a creation that&#39;s better than a trendy, over-priced sandwich.
<ul>
  <li>Bahn Mi Sausages - yeah, also from 
    <a href="http://the-meathook.com/" target="_blank">The Meat Hook</a>
  </li>
  <li>Toasted buns</li>
  <li>Picked Daikon and Carrots (see below)</li>
  <li>Onion, chopped</li>
  <li>Cilantro</li>
  <li>Sriracha</li>
  </ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Pickled Daikon and Carrots</h3>
<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
<li>1 lb. daikon radish, cut into 2-inch matchsticks</li>
<li>1 lb. carrots, cut into 2-inch matchsticks</li>
<li>1 c. white vinegar</li>
<li>1/2 c. rice vinegar</li>
<li>1/2 c. water</li>
<li>1 tbsp. salt</li>
<li>3/4 c. sugar</li>
<li>2 whole star anise</li>
</ul>
<h5>Method</h5>
<ol>
<li>Add the vinegars, water, salt and sugar to a pot and bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved.</li>
<li>Add daikon and carrots and boil for 1 minute.  Remove from heat, add star anise and let cool.</li>
<li>For immediate use, let the carrots and daikon marinate for an hour.  You can reserve what you plan on using to top the sausages and place the rest in a jar or other container and let the pickles mature, with the best results after 3-5 days.</li>
</ol></p>
