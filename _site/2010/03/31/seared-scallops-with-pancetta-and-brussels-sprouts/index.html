  <h2>Seared Scallops with Pancetta and Brussels Sprouts</h2>

<p>A co-worker asked about what to make for dinner tonight.  I replied that I need a few more constraints to make a recommendation, to which she replied that it needed to be quick and preferably possess aphrodisiac qualities.  I suggested oysters - requiring zero prep time and besides, what&#39;s sexier than an oyster? However, I had to think of an option for someone that didn&#39;t own a shucking knife or the skills to use one without losing a finger or two. My cube-mate suggested dispensing with food altogether and just opening up a bottle of booze.</p>

<p><a id="more-84"></a></p>

<p>Given those further constraints, I suggest this dish.  As for whether or not scallops have any aphrodisiac qualities beyond a mere suggestion -- remember that Aphrodite was carried to Earth in a scallop shell -- I&#39;ll have to wait until tomorrow to find out.  In the meantime, I was inspired to make the dish that I suggested.</p>

<h3>Seared Scallops with Pancetta and Brussels Sprouts</h3>

<p><i>Enough for two servings</i></p>

<h5>Ingredients</h5>

<ul>
    <li>6 large scallops</li>
    <li>1 lb. brussels sprouts, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>4 slices pancetta, chopped (about 1.5 - 2 ounces)</li>
    <li>2 shallots, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. lemon juice</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. butter</li>
</ul>

<h5>Method</h5>

<ol>
    <li>Rinse the scallops and pat dry, leaving on a paper towel to drain.  You want them to be as dry as possible so that water doesn't leach out during cooking and a proper crust forms.</li>
    <li>Heat a pan over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Add pancetta to the pan and cook until it begins to become a bit translucent, about 2 minutes.  Add shallots and saute for another 2 minutes.  Toss the brussels sprouts in and saute them for 6-7 minutes, until still a bit crunchy to provide some texture.</li>
    <li>Using your best timing skills to ensure that the scallops and the brussels sprouts are done at the same time, throw another pan on a high flame with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the tablespoon of butter.  Once the fat is nearly smoking, season the scallops with a bit of salt and pepper and add to the pan, taking care not to crowd them.  Sear the scallops for about 1 1/2 minutes on each side.  There should be a nice crust on the outside, while still being a bit translucent in the middle.</li>
    <li>Plate the brussels sprouts first and top with the scallops for a lovely presentation and go get lucky.</li>
</ol>
