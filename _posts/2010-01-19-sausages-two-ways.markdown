First off, no, this post is not about your mom's favorite porno movie - I'm keeping this strictly professional.  Well, other than the introductory sentence.

<h3>Beer Brats, Master Recipe<&#47;h3>
Being as how I live in Greenpoint, there's no better way to use the seemingly inexhaustible supply of Zyweic that to use it to prepare some brats.
<h5>Ingredients<&#47;h5>
<ul>
<li>Sausages (get them from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;the-meathook.com&#47;" target="_blank">The Meat Hook</a>, seriously)<&#47;li>
<li>Beer (two tall-boys of Zyweic is enough to cover about 6 sausages, depending on the diameter and depth of the pan)<&#47;li>
<li>1 onion, sliced into 1&#47;4 inch rings<&#47;li>
<li>2 tbsp. butter<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>
<h5>Method<&#47;h5>
<ol>
<li>Place ingredients in a pot large enough to accommodate the sausages and bring to a boil over medium heat.<&#47;li>
<li>After 8 minutes, turn the sausages.  Cook another 8 minutes.  Carefully remove the sausages from the pot and reserve.<&#47;li>
<li>Pour off the beer and simmer the onions for another 10 minutes.<&#47;li>
<li>Finish the sausages off on a grill, about 2-3 minutes per side, depending on the heat of the coals.  Toast the buns on the grill and serve.<&#47;li>
<&#47;ol>

<hr&#47;>

<h3>Milwaukee<&#47;h3>
You don't have to drink like you're from Milwaukee to appreciate these sausages.  Although they do taste better when you do.  Not that I want to discourage you from making these, while they were amazing, next time, I'm totally going to do these francheezie-style.  If you're not from Chicago, then you probably have no idea what I'm talking about.  So let me introduce you to the ultimate Da Bears heart-attack-inducing amazingness in the universe.  However, my lawyer advised that I insert this legalese: <i>By reading this, I hereby swear that I will not hold the author of this website accountable in any manner for any negative health- or relationship-related consequences.<&#47;i> With that out of the way, let's get down to business: First, you take a hot dog (for full-on artery hardening I wholly endorse the usage of Bacon-Cheeseburger Sausages), then wrap that in American cheese.  Then, because that might actually be healthy or make it's way onto a school lunch menu, wrap that in bacon.  And because that might somehow leave your cardiologist with something to say about your dietary habits, deep-fry that muthaf*cka so he&#47;she can't say anything, only pick up his&#47;her jaw from the floor knowing that you&#47;your insurance company will soon be paying him&#47;her for your quadruple bypass.
<ul>
<li>Grilled Bacon-Cheeseburger Sausages  (from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;the-meathook.com&#47;" target="_blank">The Meat Hook</a>, duh)<&#47;li>
<li>Toasted buns<&#47;li>
<li>Cheddar cheese<&#47;li>
<li>Mustard<&#47;li>
<li>Grilled onions (see above)<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

<h3>Vietnam<&#47;h3>
Too bad I can't figure out how to get the appropriate little accent mark over the "a" in Bahn Mi.  Either way, here's a creation that's better than a trendy, over-priced sandwich.
<ul>
<li>Bahn Mi Sausages (yeah, also from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;the-meathook.com&#47;" target="_blank">The Meat Hook</a>)<&#47;li>
<li>Toasted buns<&#47;li>
<li>Picked Daikon and Carrots (see below)<&#47;li>
<li>Onion, chopped<&#47;li>
<li>Cilantro<&#47;li>
<li>Sriracha<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

<hr&#47;>

<h3>Pickled Daikon and Carrots<&#47;h3>
<h5>Ingredients<&#47;h5>
<ul>
<li>1 lb. daikon radish, cut into 2-inch matchsticks<&#47;li>
<li>1 lb. carrots, cut into 2-inch matchsticks<&#47;li>
<li>1 c. white vinegar<&#47;li>
<li>1&#47;2 c. rice vinegar<&#47;li>
<li>1&#47;2 c. water<&#47;li>
<li>1 tbsp. salt<&#47;li>
<li>3&#47;4 c. sugar<&#47;li>
<li>2 whole star anise<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>
<h5>Method<&#47;h5>
<ol>
<li>Add the vinegars, water, salt and sugar to a pot and bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved.<&#47;li>
<li>Add daikon and carrots and boil for 1 minute.  Remove from heat, add star anise and let cool.<&#47;li>
<li>For immediate use, let the carrots and daikon marinate for an hour.  You can reserve what you plan on using to top the sausages and place the rest in a jar or other container and let the pickles mature, with the best results after 3-5 days.<&#47;li>
<&#47;ol>
