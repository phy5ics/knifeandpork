  content: I hope there are some tasty meats in those dumplings. I want to see a knife
    stabbing a pig or at least a piece of steak choking on a piece of bacon. I only
    like butternut squashes when they are made of steaks.

The greenbeans were easy, as they're a fallback side for me.  Simply boiling them up and then after 7 minutes, tossing them with olive oil, fresh lemon juice, salt and pepper makes a nice side with some acid that balances out a heavier main.  The pierogi would be fried up in butter and served with sour cream, another easy win.  But what to do with the butternut squash?

After a quick fridge and pantry check yielded some cream left over from panna cotta, parmesan and a bit of fresh sage.  The fix was in and a gratin ensued.
