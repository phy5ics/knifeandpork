<h3>Black-Eyed Peas with Smoked Ham Hocks<&#47;h3>
<h5>Ingredients<&#47;h5>
<ul>
	<li>1 pound dried black-eyed peas<&#47;li>
	<li>1 smoked ham hock<&#47;li>
	<li>1 white onion coarsely chopped<&#47;li>
	<li>3 large cloves garlic, halved<&#47;li>
	<li>1 bay leaf<&#47;li>
	<li>1 tablespoon Creole seasoning (see below)<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>
<h5>Method<&#47;h5>
In a large Dutch oven or kettle, combine the black-eyed peas, ham bone or ham hocks, and 6 cups water. Add the onion to the pot along with the garlic and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer gently until the beans are tender but not mushy, 1 to 1 1&#47;2 hours. Remove the ham bone or hocks, cut off the meat; dice and set aside. Remove and discard the bay leaf.  Serve over white rice with hot sauce and freshly baked cornbread.

<h5>Ingredients<&#47;h5>
