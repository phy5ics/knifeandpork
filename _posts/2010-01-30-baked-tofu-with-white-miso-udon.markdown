After a trip to Han Ah Reum on 32rd Street in Manhattan to grab ingredients for kimchi and coming away with some other goodies that jammed a bunch of ingredients into the fridge and pantry, I threw this together one night.  While the list of ingredients seems a bit long, most of them are pantry items if you do some amount of Asian cooking.

<h3>Baked Tofu with White Miso Udon</h3>
<i>Makes 2 servings</i>

<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
<li>1 package extra-firm tofu, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes</li>
<li>2 small packages fresh soba noodles</li>
<li>1/2 lb. mushrooms (shiitake, baby portabello, etc.)</li>
<li>2 c. spinach leaves, washed and trimmed</li>
<li>1 green onion, both green and white part thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 tbsp. cilantro, coarsely chopped</li>
<li>2 tbsp. ginger, minced</li>
<li>4 tbsp. toasted sesame seeds</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>2 tbsp. soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tbsp. sesame oil</li>
<li>2 tbsp. white miso paste</li>
<li>2 tbsp. rice vinegar</li>
<li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
<li>Red pepper flakes or togarashi (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Method</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, ginger, cilantro, garlic and green onion in a bowl.  Add tofu and marinate, turning every 10 minutes for as long as you can stand.  I usually shoot for about 30 minutes, as the longer the tofu steeps in the goodness, the more pronounced the flavor.</li>
<li>I'm not sure if you have had the pleasure of getting baked-on soy sauce off of a baking sheet.  Unless you would like to discover this pleasure, line it your baking sheet with foil and place the marinated tofu on it.  Sprinkle about 1/4 toasted sesame seeds on top of the tofu and place in the oven.  Turn the tofu every 10 minutes and sprinkle more sesame seeds each time you turn them.  Bake for about 40 minutes until the tofu loses some of its moisture and firms up, becoming a nice caramel color.</li>
<li>While the tofu is baking, set a pot of water on the stove and bring to a boil for the soba.  For the miso sauce, combine 1/4 c. water with the miso and remaining rice vinegar and reserve.</li>
<li>Saute the mushrooms in the olive oil over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Add the soba to the boiling water and cook according to the directions on the package (it's usually about 2 minutes for fresh soba).  Remove from the mushrooms from the pan and add in the spinach, cooking until just wilted, about 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
<li>If your timing is good, this should all come together fast-and-furious styles.  Strain and divide soba between two large bowls, mix the miso sauce with the soba in the bowls.  Top the soba with the mushrooms, spinach and baked tofu.  Add red pepper flakes or togarashi to taste if you like some heat.</li>
</ol>
