<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
<li>1 whole chicken, about 4 lbs.</li>
<li>2 lemon quarters</li>
<li>3 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
<li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
<li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
<li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
<li>6 cloves garlic, 2 whole, 4 minced</li>
<li>8 largish new potatoes, halved</li>
<li>4 large carrots, cut in 3-in. pieces along the bias</li>
<li>4 shallots, halved</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<h5>Method</h5>
<ol>
<li>Set oven to <i>kill</i>, or if your oven does not have that setting, place a sticker saying <i>"kill"</i> at the 500&deg; F marker.  Place potatoes, carrots and shallots in the bottom of a dutch oven.</li>
<li>Place the butter in a small dish and microwave for 20-30 seconds until melted. Gah! I know.  Combine with the 2 tbsp. olive oil.  Finely mince the leaves of one sprig each of rosemary and thyme and add to the butter/olive oil mixture along with the minced garlic.</li>
<li>Time to roll up your sleeves.  Wash your bird and pat dry.  Using your fingers, gently separate the skin from the flesh on the breasts and thighs to create pockets, being careful not to tear the skin.  Once that is done, stuff the butter/olive oil/herb mixture into the pockets.  This will allow the flavors to permeate the chicken and keep the garlic from burning at the high temperatures.  Stuff the remaining rosemary, thyme, garlic cloves and lemon quarters into the chicken cavity.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper the chicken and then tie up that bird up like Julia taught you how to do.  Place the chicken breast side down in the dutch oven and place in the oven.</li>
<li>Roast for 30 minutes, then using giant tongs, take the bird out, stir the veggies in the bottom of the pot and place the chicken back in the pot breast side up.  Roast another 30 minutes or until the chicken reaches an internal temp of 165&deg;.  Remove from heat and let rest for 5-10 minutes.</li>
<li>Carve and serve alongside spinach or broccoli rabe sauteed with olive oil, garlic and red pepper to round out the meal.</li>
</ol>
