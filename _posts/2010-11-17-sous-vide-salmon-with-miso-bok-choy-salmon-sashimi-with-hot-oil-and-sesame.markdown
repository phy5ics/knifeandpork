About to introduce the vacuum-sealed salmon with a bit of lemon zest, salt and pepper to the Sous Vide Supreme on its maiden voyage.

Salmon sashimi prepared with a hot sesame oil and soy dressing, scallions, black toasted sesame seeds and cilantro.

The salmon was cooked to perfection in about 20 minutes.  One thing that I found a bit odd in my first encounter with preparing a sous vide dish was the lack of smell.  It seems extremely futuristic and sterile to not have any sensory input along the lines of smell and sight during the cooking process.  Despite this, I think that I'm going to get some great use out of the Sous Vide Supreme.
