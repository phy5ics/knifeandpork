  content: Wonderful dish!  I've made a variation with asparagus.  Brussels sprouts
    sound even better.  This will be tonight's dinner, something light to prepare
    for tomorrow's rack of lamb.

A co-worker asked about what to make for dinner tonight.  I replied that I need a few more constraints to make a recommendation, to which she replied that it needed to be quick and preferably possess aphrodisiac qualities.  I suggested oysters - requiring zero prep time and besides, what's sexier than an oyster? However, I had to think of an option for someone that didn't own a shucking knife or the skills to use one without losing a finger or two. My cube-mate suggested dispensing with food altogether and just opening up a bottle of booze.

Given those further constraints, I suggest this dish.  As for whether or not scallops have any aphrodisiac qualities beyond a mere suggestion -- remember that Aphrodite was carried to Earth in a scallop shell -- I'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out.  In the meantime, I was inspired to make the dish that I suggested.

<h3>Seared Scallops with Pancetta and Brussels Sprouts<&#47;h3>

<i>Enough for two servings<&#47;i>

<h5>Ingredients<&#47;h5>
<ul>
	<li>6 large scallops<&#47;li>
	<li>1 lb. brussels sprouts, thinly sliced<&#47;li>
	<li>4 slices pancetta, chopped (about 1.5 - 2 ounces)<&#47;li>
	<li>2 shallots, thinly sliced<&#47;li>
	<li>1 tbsp. lemon juice<&#47;li>
	<li>2 tbsp. olive oil<&#47;li>
	<li>1 tbsp. butter<&#47;li>
<&#47;ul>

<&#47;h5>Method<&#47;h5>
<ol>
	<li>Rinse the scallops and pat dry, leaving on a paper towel to drain.  You want them to be as dry as possible so that water doesn't leach out during cooking and a proper crust forms.<&#47;li>
	<li>Heat a pan over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Add pancetta to the pan and cook until it begins to become a bit translucent, about 2 minutes.  Add shallots and saute for another 2 minutes.  Toss the brussels sprouts in and saute them for 6-7 minutes, until still a bit crunchy to provide some texture.<&#47;li>
	<li>Using your best timing skills to ensure that the scallops and the brussels sprouts are done at the same time, throw another pan on a high flame with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the tablespoon of butter.  Once the fat is nearly smoking, season the scallops with a bit of salt and pepper and add to the pan, taking care not to crowd them.  Sear the scallops for about 1 1&#47;2 minutes on each side.  There should be a nice crust on the outside, while still being a bit translucent in the middle.<&#47;li>
	<li>Plate the brussels sprouts first and top with the scallops for a lovely presentation and go get lucky.<&#47;li>
<&#47;ol>
