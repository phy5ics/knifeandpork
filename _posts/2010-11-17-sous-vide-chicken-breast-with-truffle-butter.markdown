Sous Vide Chicken Breast with Truffle Butter, Corn Pudding and Wilted Spinach.

The second experiment with the Sous Vide Supreme, and another masterpiece.  The chicken was cooked with nothing but a bit salt, pepper and some amazing truffle butter.  It didn't really need anything else at all.  Well, other than the shiitake mushroom-shallot sauce that I topped it with.
